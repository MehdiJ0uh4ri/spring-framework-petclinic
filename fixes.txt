Searching the Internet, I found this JetBrains forum post from 11 Nov 2025 which seemed to show many people with a similar error, which started happening suddenly today.

Therefore I concluded this Docker update includes a breaking change, and indeed this turns out to be so:

    The daemon now requires API version v1.44 or later (Docker v25.0+).

I ran this command to determine what version to downgrade to:

apt list -a docker-ce | head

Output:

Listing...
docker-ce/jammy,now 5:29.0.0-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy amd64 [installed]
docker-ce/jammy 5:28.5.2-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy amd64
docker-ce/jammy 5:28.5.1-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy amd64
docker-ce/jammy 5:28.5.0-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy amd64

To downgrade from 5:29 to 5:28.5.2 I ran:

sudo apt remove docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo apt install -y \
    docker-ce=5:28.5.2-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy \
    docker-ce-cli=5:28.5.2-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy \
    containerd.io
sudo systemctl restart docker
docker version # To check we are now on the correct Docker version







This can be resolved without having to downgrade Docker. Add a file, /etc/docker/daemon.json, containing

{"min-api-version": "1.32"}

Then execute sudo systemctl restart docker.

Use whatever minimum API version is reported in your case. In this case, it was 1.32*. In other cases, it might be different, like 1.24, depending on the system.





here is an issue raised with Testcontainers about this.

If you can run Testcontainers 2.x, update to 2.0.2 or later. If not, update to 1.21.4.

If you cannot update at all for now, the following hotfix can be used as a workaround:

echo api.version=1.44 >> ~/.docker-java.properties





    Error response from daemon: client version 1.41 is too old.

Is this still an issue? It could be the version of the kreuzworker/docker plugin is old. You could try change it to 3.6.2 and see if it behaves better? Your version of docker seems OK. Might also be worth double checking the version of terraform you’re using too.

What happened?

After updating Docker to version 29, the Docker environment could no longer be found.
After downgrading to version 28.5.2, it worked again.

According to Docker, there are breaking changes in this version.

Looks like quite a big jump in the Docker API - from minimum version 1.24 to 1.44.

Our Testcontainers setup reports:

    Client version 1.32 is too old. Minimum supported API version is 1.44. Please upgrade your client to a newer version.

There is this code that sets the TC version if it cannot find a declared one:

`public static DockerClient getClientForConfig(TransportConfig transportConfig) {
final DockerHttpClient dockerHttpClient;

    String transportType = TestcontainersConfiguration.getInstance().getTransportType();
    switch (transportType) {
        case "httpclient5":
            dockerHttpClient =
                new ZerodepDockerHttpClient.Builder()
                    .dockerHost(transportConfig.getDockerHost())
                    .sslConfig(transportConfig.getSslConfig())
                    .build();
            break;
        default:
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown transport type '" + transportType + "'");
    }

    DefaultDockerClientConfig.Builder configBuilder = DefaultDockerClientConfig.createDefaultConfigBuilder();

    if (configBuilder.build().getApiVersion() == RemoteApiVersion.UNKNOWN_VERSION) {
        configBuilder.withApiVersion(RemoteApiVersion.VERSION_1_32);
    }
    Map<String, String> headers = new HashMap<>();
    headers.put("x-tc-sid", DockerClientFactory.SESSION_ID);
    headers.put("User-Agent", String.format("tc-java/%s", DockerClientFactory.TESTCONTAINERS_VERSION));

    return DockerClientImpl.getInstance(
        new AuthDelegatingDockerClientConfig(
            configBuilder.withDockerHost(transportConfig.getDockerHost().toString()).build()
        ),
        new HeadersAddingDockerHttpClient(dockerHttpClient, headers)
    );
}

`

This is causing the test to run with an old client version. I don't know what was changed in the new docker release, actively looking in to this also.



Same problem here.

My host is a Debian 12 and the official Docker package was updated today.

Apparently it has now a minimum 1.44 level API requirement and it's rejecting connections:

Server: Docker Engine - Community
 Engine:
  Version:          29.0.0
  API version:      1.52 (minimum version 1.44)

Downgraded Docker to previous version and Traefik works again:

Server: Docker Engine - Community
 Engine:
  Version:          28.5.2
  API version:      1.51 (minimum version 1.24)

Same here on Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.

I just updated to Docker 29 and it broke. It seems Docker upped the minimum API version.

1.24 is so wildly old. I hope it wont take too long to release a new version.

to revert on ubuntu i did

# to get available version
apt-cache madison docker-ce

# install specific version
apt-get install docker-ce=5:28.5.2-1~ubuntu.24.04~noble \
                     docker-ce-cli=5:28.5.2-1~ubuntu.24.04~noble \

Docker Engine v29: Foundational Updates for the Future
Posted Nov 11, 2025
Colin Hemmings

This post is for Linux users running Docker Engine (Community Edition) directly on their hosts. Docker Desktop users don’t need to take any action — Engine updates are included automatically in future Desktop releases.

Docker Engine v29 is a foundational release that sets the stage for the future of the Docker platform. While it may not come with flashy new features, it introduces a few significant under-the-hood changes that simplify our architecture and improve ecosystem alignment:

    Minimum API version update
    The Containerd image store is now the default for new installations.
    Migration to Go modules
    Experimental Support for NFTables

These changes improve maintainability, developer experience, and interoperability across the container ecosystem.

Minimum API Version Update

Docker versions older than v25 are now end of life, and as such, we have increased the Minimum API version to 1.44 (Moby v25). 

If you are getting the following error, you will need to update to a newer client or follow the mitigation steps to override the min-version

Error response from daemon: client version 1.43 is too old.
Minimum supported API version is 1.44, please upgrade your client to a newer version

Override the minimum API version

There are two methods to launch dockerd with a lower minimum API version. Additional information can be found on docs.docker.com

Using flags when starting dockerd

Launch dockerd with the DOCKER_MIN_API_VERSION set to the previous value. For example:
1
	
DOCKER_MIN_API_VERSION=1.24 dockerd

Using a JSON configuration file — daemon.json

Set min-api-version in your daemon.json file.
1
2
3
	
{
  "min-api-version": "1.24"
}

Containerd Image Store Becomes the Default

Why We Made This Change

The Containerd runtime originated as a core component of Docker Engine and was later split out and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It now serves as the industry-standard container runtime, powering Kubernetes and many other platforms.

While Docker introduced containerd for container execution years ago, we continued using the graph driver storage backend for managing image layers. Meanwhile, containerd evolved its own image content store and snapshotter framework, designed for modularity, performance, and ecosystem alignment.

To ensure stability, Docker has been gradually migrating to the containerd image store over time. Docker Desktop has already used the containerd image store as the default for most of the past year. With Docker Engine v29, this migration takes the next step by becoming the default in the Moby engine.






docker compose up returns the message:

Error response from daemon: client version 1.41 is too old. Minimum supported API version is 1.44, please upgrade your client to a newer version

However, the output from docker version reports API version 1.52:

  GitCommit:        de40ad0

docker compose version reports: Docker Compose Version v2.2.3

There are no further updates available when using apt upgrade.

I do not have the docker API version defined in either an environment variable or the daemon.json config file.

I have seen other people solve this problem by downgrading docker. I would rather stay up to date with the versions.

    I would like to note that i do not appreciate the edit of the title. The way it is written now assumes the problem. How do you know that it is the client that reports the wrong version? Docker wasn't even installed when the API version 1.41 was current. The host has never used 1.41. –

Your version of docker compose is out of date. The current release is v5.0.0. This is a plugin to the docker CLI, so only upgrading the CLI will not upgrade the compose plugin depending on how you have installed each.

The steps to upgrade compose depend on how you have installed it. On Debian, I have it installed via the docker-compose-plugin package in apt. If you manually installed it, you may see the binary in your home directory $HOME/.docker/cli-plugins or system wide in a location like /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins. The compose repo has more details: https://github.com/docker/compose#where-to-get-docker-compose









Description

On Ubuntu 22.04.5, since a recent apt-get upgrade which brought docker -ce version 29.x instead of 28.x, I now met this error while running some compose commands:

$ docker compose ps
